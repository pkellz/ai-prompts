## Usage

`@implement-issue {ISSUE_KEY}` will implement the work for Jira issue {ISSUE_KEY}. 

If you are not already aware about Jira issue {ISSUE_KEY}, use `@pull-issue {ISSUE_KEY}` to fetch issue details via the Atlassian MCP server.

Then checkout a branch with a name like `{ISSUE_KEY}-{BRANCH_NAME}`.

Then begin implementing the issue such that the requirements / acceptance criteria are met. For any Figma links you encounter, use the Figma MCP to fetch the design data. DO NOT commit any changes yet as I would like to review them first.


## Best Practices

### 1. Code Changes
- Follow coding standards
- Add/update tests
- Update any relevant documentation
- Handle edge cases

### 2. Testing
- Add new test cases as needed
- Update existing tests as needed
- Test edge cases as needed
- Verify accessibility as needed

### 3. Error Handling
- Handle implementation errors
- Provide clear error messages
- Roll back failed changes
- Log issues
- Suggest fixes

### 4. Documentation
- Update component docs as needed
- Add code comments as needed
- Update README if needed
- Document breaking changes as needed
- Note any tech debt

## Implementation Strategies

### 1. Component Changes
```typescript
// Before implementing UI changes:
1. Create/update component
2. Add props/interfaces
3. Implement logic
4. Add styles
```

### 2. API Changes
```typescript
// Before implementing API changes:
1. Update interfaces
2. Implement endpoints
3. Add validation
4. Add error handling
```

## Example
```bash
@implement-issue BYTE-13290
```
